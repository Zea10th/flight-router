# Flight Router

Flight Router is a part of sophisticated system designed to handle air travel logistics with precision and efficiency.
At its core, it manages the intricacies of flight itineraries, breaking them down into individual segments for seamless
organization and coordination.

## Key Features

+ **Segmentation Management:** Flight Router excels in segmenting flight itineraries into atomic units, known as
  segments. Each segment encapsulates crucial flight details such as departure and arrival times.
+ **Route Filtering:** Flight Router filters routes by presented rules to ensure optimal time and efficiency.

## What Can Be Improved

Unify requirements for flight filtering rules.  
Due to uncertain requirements for flight filtering rules, the functionality of the module was checked in the `main()` method.
